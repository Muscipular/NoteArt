## How to build the project
1. Download the package from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x123tfxyc48ze6p/AADoYJf5oPL4-HhsWUYB85YTa) or [Baidu](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1c0D14J2#dir/path=%2FNoteArt)

2. Extract it into root folder of your repository. The folder should be looked like :
```
    %rootpath%
       |-  .git/
       |-  NoteArt/
       |-  packages/
       |-  .gitignore
       |-  NoteArt.sln
       |-  ........
```
    ( Be aware, there should be 4 folders and a repositories.config in the packages folder. )

3. Open the solution from FILE ->Open -> Project/Solution menu in Visual Studio 2012

4. Press Start to build it
